# Backbase Test

FRAMEWORKS:

 *CUCUMBER
      Cucumber is a tool that supports Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) - a software
      development process that aims to enhance software quality and reduce maintenance costs.

      Cucumber executes *executable specifications* written in plain language (gherking) 
      and produces reports indicating whether the software behaves according to the
      specification or not.

      Cucumber reduces the effort to keep requirements specifications, tests and documentation
      in sync - with Cucumber they are all the same documents - a single source of truth
      for everyone on the team.

      Cucumber is compatible with all the major software platforms.

*SELENIUM
       Selenium is an umbrella project encapsulating a variety of tools and libraries enabling web browser automation. 
      Selenium specifically provides infrastructure for the W3C WebDriver specification â€” a platform and language-neutral coding
      interface compatible with all major web browsers.
