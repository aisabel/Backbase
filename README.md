Frameworks description:

*Selenium is an umbrella project encapsulating a variety of tools and libraries enabling web browser automation. Selenium specifically provides infrastructure for the W3C WebDriver specification â€” a platform and language-neutral coding interface compatible with all major web browsers.

*Cucumber is a tool that supports Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) - a software development process that aims to enhance software quality and reduce maintenance costs.

Cucumber executes executable specifications written in plain language and produces reports indicating whether the software behaves according to the specification or not.

Cucumber reduces the effort to keep requirements specifications, tests and documentation in sync - with Cucumber they are all the same documents - a single source of truth for everyone on the team.
